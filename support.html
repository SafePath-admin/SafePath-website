  <h1>Responder Support Resources</h1>
  <p>
    This page is for responders. No speeches. No judgment. Just options.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>If you need someone right now</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Anonymous Responder Chat (SafePath)</strong><br />
      <a href="https://tlk.io/safepath-anonymous-chat">Open the anonymous chat</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re in immediate danger, or you can’t stay safe where you are:
    call your local emergency number, or go to the nearest emergency department.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>When you’re not in immediate danger — but you’re not okay</h2>
  <p>
    Pick one small next step. You don’t have to solve everything tonight.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Text / call a trusted person.</strong> One person. One message.</li>
    <li><strong>Get out of isolation.</strong> Sit where someone else is, even quietly.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce access to lethal means.</strong> Create distance. Add time. Hand it off if you can.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrate + eat something simple.</strong> Then reassess.</li>
    <li><strong>Try a 10–15 minute reset.</strong> Shower, step outside, slow breathing, or a short walk.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>Responder-specific support</h2>
  <p>
    If you have access to any of these through your agency or region, use them:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Peer Support / CISM / Chaplain</li>
    <li>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</li>
    <li>Union / Benevolent / Association support</li>
    <li>Supervisor you trust (only if it’s safe to do so)</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>Confidential crisis lines (U.S.)</h2>
  <p>
    These are general crisis resources. Use whatever gets you connected fastest.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>988</strong> — Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline (call or text)</li>
    <li><strong>911</strong> — Emergency</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re outside the U.S., use your country’s local emergency number or crisis service.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>What SafePath is (and isn’t)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SafePath is:</strong> a responder-built safety initiative, going live in stages.</li>
    <li><strong>SafePath isn’t:</strong> emergency dispatch, medical care, or a guarantee of confidentiality on your device/network.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re worried about privacy, use a personal device and a network you trust.
  </p>
