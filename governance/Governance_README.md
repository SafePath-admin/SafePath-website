# SafePath Initiative — Governance Overview

## Purpose

This folder contains the **authoritative governance records** for the SafePath Initiative. Its purpose is to preserve a clear, accurate, and append-only record of decisions, milestones, and structural development so that SafePath’s mission, integrity, and origins remain understandable and defensible over time.

This governance record exists to:

* Maintain institutional memory
* Support continuity beyond any single individual
* Provide transparency for trusted advisors, partners, and reviewers
* Protect the integrity of the SafePath Initiative and its intellectual property

⸻

## Source of Truth

All files within the `/governance` directory are considered **canonical records**. When conflicts arise between documentation elsewhere (emails, chats, drafts, or site copy), the contents of this folder take precedence.

⸻

## Master Progress Log

### File: `Progress_Log.md`

The **Master Progress Log** is the central, append-only timeline of the SafePath Initiative.

It records:

* Major decisions and design locks
* Vendor engagements and deliverables
* Legal, brand, and IP milestones
* Structural changes to programs, terminology, or assets

### Formatting Standard

All entries follow:

**Progress Log v1.7 (FULL • SOURCE-VERIFIED)**

Key characteristics:

* Chronological, month-by-month structure
* Timestamped entries in `[HH:MM]` format
* Plain-text, neutral, factual language
* Section dividers using `⸻`
* End-of-entry summary tables when appropriate

### Append-Only Rule

The Progress Log is **append-only**:

* Past entries are not rewritten or deleted
* Corrections or clarifications are logged as new entries
* Superseded information is noted, not erased

This rule exists to preserve historical integrity.

⸻

## Log-Worthy Events

An event should be logged when it:

* Locks a decision that affects direction, scope, or identity
* Commits SafePath to a vendor, partner, or external dependency
* Establishes or modifies legal, brand, or IP posture
* Marks a meaningful milestone in development or deployment

Minor drafts, exploratory ideas, or informal discussions are generally **not logged** unless they result in a binding decision.

⸻

## Brand and IP Records

### Folder: `Brand_and_IP/`

This folder contains the **authoritative brand assets and rules**, including:

* Master logo files (SVG, AI/EPS, PDF)
* Official fonts
* Brand usage rules and constraints

Brand assets stored here are the **source of truth** and should not be modified without corresponding documentation in the Master Progress Log.

⸻

## Legal and Compliance Records

### Folder: `Legal_and_Compliance/`

This folder is reserved for:

* NDA language
* IP filings and timelines
* Statutory references relevant to SafePath (e.g., responder peer support protections)

Materials here may inform external review but do not replace formal legal counsel.

⸻

## Archive

### Folder: `Archive/`

Nothing in governance is deleted.

Superseded drafts, deprecated documents, and replaced assets are moved to the Archive with their historical context preserved.

⸻

## Access and Stewardship

* **Write access** is intentionally limited to preserve integrity
* **Read-only access** may be granted to trusted advisors, partners, or reviewers
* The SafePath Initiative coordinator serves as the primary steward of these records

⸻

## Closing Note

This governance structure exists to ensure that SafePath remains:

* Mission-aligned
* Ethically grounded
* Historically accurate
* Resistant to drift, dilution, or misinterpretation

The goal is continuity — not control — and clarity over time.
