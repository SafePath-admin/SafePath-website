# SafePath Initiative — Master Progress Log

**Document Status:** Authoritative • Append-Only
**Formatting Standard:** Progress Log v1.7 (FULL • SOURCE-VERIFIED)

⸻

## Purpose

This Master Progress Log serves as the **official chronological record** of the SafePath Initiative.

It documents:

* Strategic decisions and design locks
* Program architecture and terminology changes
* Vendor engagements and external dependencies
* Brand, legal, and intellectual property milestones
* Deployment phases and continuity-relevant events

The intent of this log is not narrative storytelling, but **accurate institutional memory**.

## Governing Principles

1. **Append-Only**
   Entries are never deleted or rewritten. Corrections or clarifications are logged as new entries.

2. **Chronological Integrity**
   Entries are organized by month and timestamped in `[HH:MM]` format.

3. **Source-Verified**
   External actions (vendors, filings, approvals) are recorded with sufficient context to verify origin.

4. **Neutral Tone**
   Language remains factual, concise, and non-editorial.

## Formatting Structure

Each log entry follows this structure:

* Month / Year header
* Date header
* Timestamped entries with brief descriptive titles
* Section dividers using `⸻`
* End-of-section summary tables when applicable

Example:

```
